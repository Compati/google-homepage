Deconstructing and rebuilding a webpage - First HTML project
Still learning a lot of the nuances of HTML and CSS, but by inspecting several different pages and reworking a big part of the page I was finally able to get a similar looking google search page.  I was able to learn how to group elements into different blocks and adjust how they are displayed.  Created a basic HTML file then used used a CSS file to change the way the page is displayed.  Adjusting margins and paddings as well as adding borders (or taking them away) and creating a round radius on them.  Displaying navigation bars on the top and bottom and adjusting each to either be on the left or right.  Inserting an image and adjusting its place on the page.  Also debugging my own code - realized I had an extra </div> at one point which altered how the footer background was being displayed.  Many lessons were learned and I am sure many will be coming.  Really cool place to start the learning process for my first project.
